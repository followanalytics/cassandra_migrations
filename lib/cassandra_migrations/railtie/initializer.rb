# In production (when Passenger is used with smart spawn), many ruby processes are created
# by forking the original spawner. Since the child process is a different process, it shares
# no memory with its father. Because of that we have to connect to cassandra again.
# It is also common that file descriptors are unintentionally shared when the process forks,
# that's why we go through the safe path and check if the client exists in order to restart it
# (production tests have shown that the client is nil when forked)
